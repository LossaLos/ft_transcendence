        - SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ADD IF BLOCKED
        - SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BLOCK IF ALREADY BLOCK
        - SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNBLOCK IF INITIATOR ONLY (SHOUDL MATCH LOGIC WITH FIRST BULLET POINT)
        - SHOULD HAVE NORMAL REMOVE FRIEND/ADD FRIEND LOGIC (CHECK 2nd BULLET POINT JUST IN CASE)

SOCIAL: - SHOULD NOT "FIND" USER IF YOU HAVE BEEN BLOCKED BY THAT USER
        - CAN'T ADD AS FRIEND (SHOULD BE ALREADY MANAGED WITH ADD LOGIC)


SETTINGS:
        - 42AUTH SHOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT LOGIC IN ORDER TO CHANGE USERNAME ONLY. (As this user doesn't and won't have a current password)
